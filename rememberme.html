    <h1>Remember Me</h1>

    <p>Speak of me as you have always done,<br>
    Remember the good times, laughter and fun.<br>
    Share the happy memories we’ve made,<br>
    Do not let them wither or fade.</p>

    <p>I’ll be with you in the summer’s sun,<br>
    And when the winter’s chill has come.<br>
    I’ll be the voice that whispers in the breeze,<br>
    I’m peaceful now, put your mind at ease.</p>

    <p>I’ve rested my eyes and gone to sleep,<br>
    But memories we’ve shared are yours to keep.<br>
    Sometimes our final days may be a test,<br>
    But remember me when I was at my best.</p>

    <p>Although things may not be the same,<br>
    Don’t be afraid to use my name.<br>
    Let your sorrow last for just a while,<br>
    Comfort each other and try to smile.</p>

    <p>I’ve lived a life full of joy and fun,<br>
    Live on now, make me proud of what you’ll become.</p>
