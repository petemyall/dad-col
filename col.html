    <h1>Celebration of Life – Fred Myall</h1>

    <p>We are here today to celebrate the life of Fred Myall — a husband, dad, brother, grandad, great-grandad, and a much-loved friend.</p>

    <p>Fred was born on the 4th of August 1932 on the King’s Road in Chelsea, London, to Florence and George Myall. He grew up just behind Sloane Square station in Whitaker Street, alongside his sister Patsie, and attended St Joseph’s School locally.</p>

    <p>When he left school, Fred started work as a plumber’s mate — a hands-on beginning that suited him perfectly.</p>

    <p>In 1949, Fred met Babs. They courted for a while and married on the 27th of March 1954 at St Simon’s Church in Chelsea, beginning a partnership that would shape the rest of his life.</p>

    <p>In 1950, while Fred was courting Babs, he began two years of National Service as a gunner looking after Heavy Anti Aircraft guns at Gillingham in Kent. On one occasion, keen to take Babs to a show, Fred went to see the doctor — hoping for a quick solution. Instead, it backfired rather spectacularly. He was whisked off to hospital, had his appendix removed, and the evening out never happened.</p>

    <p>Their first three children, Pete, Sue, and Dave, arrived in quick succession by August 1957. The flat was now too small for them so the family then moved to Swindon, where three more children followed — Steve, Jeanette and Ali. The family was complete by the end of 1964.</p>

    <p>Fred worked for Plesseys for a few years before the company moved out of Swindon and he decided to become a self-employed plumber, working in London during the week and coming home at weekends. Those weekends were always special — especially for the children, who knew that Dad coming home meant tubes of Smarties. It was just one of the many ways Fred brought happiness into everyday life.</p>

    <p>Mischief was always at the heart of the Myall household. Fred had a playful streak and a knack for harmless trouble, and everyone who knew him knew to stay just a little bit alert — because if something unexpected happened, Fred was usually at the centre of it, quietly enjoying himself.</p>

    <p>In the late 1960s, the family moved to Erith in Kent for a few years before settling in Bracknell in 1971. Fred lived there for the next 55 years, and it remains the family home to this day.</p>

    <p>Fred and Babs gave the children wonderful memories through family holidays to places like Butlins and Devon — full of fun, togetherness, and simple pleasures.</p>

    <p>One holiday in Devon produced a story that became family legend. Fred went to the pub with his brothers-in-law Mike and Dave, along with friend and neighbour Trevor. After several hours — and rather a lot of beer — concern grew, and a search party was sent out to find them. They were eventually discovered sitting quite happily on a bench built around a large oak tree, completely convinced they were on a roundabout.</p>

    <p>They weren’t too much the worse for wear the next morning either. In fact, Fred and Dave were mischievous enough to place a kipper into Mike’s car engine compartment — resulting in several days of puzzled searching as everyone tried to locate the source of an increasingly dreadful smell.</p>

    <p>Babs sadly passed away in 2007, and Fred continued to live independently, with all the children close by and very much part of his life.</p>

    <p>Fred was a devoted supporter of Chelsea Football Club from a very young age. In the early years, he went regularly with Babs, until Pete was born. After that, Fred became a familiar figure heading off to matches with his sons. During the family’s years in Swindon, he also took an interest in Swindon Town as the local team.</p>

    <p>One particularly special memory was when Fred took Pete and Dave to Wembley in 1969 to watch the League Cup Final between Swindon Town and Arsenal. It was a famous day, with Swindon causing a huge upset by winning 3–1 — a match Fred never forgot.</p>

    <p>Fred also loved playing darts and won many trophies over the years. He and Babs also loved going to bingo together, later taking up golf with Dave and Steve.</p>

    <p>Along with Babs, he loved family gatherings and regularly organised parties for friends and family, either at home or small local venues. These always ended as a loud sing-song which was enjoyed by all those present.</p>

    <p>In the later years the choice of holiday changed to villas in the Mediterranean, always with various members of the family.</p>

    <p>Through his six children came the many grandchildren and, later, great-grandchildren. Fred loved being a grandad and great-grandad and treasured the time he spent with them.</p>

    <p>In 2017, Fred was diagnosed with dementia. Sue moved in with him for around four years to care for him, followed by Jeanette for five years, with enormous support from Ali as well. Their love, dedication, and care allowed Fred to remain where he wanted to be — at home.</p>

    <p>In keeping with his wishes, Fred passed away peacefully at home.</p>

    <p>He will be deeply missed, forever loved, and always remembered — not just for the life he lived, but for the warmth, character, and quiet mischief he brought into the lives of everyone around him.</p>
