    <h1>Pete's Words</h1>

    <p>Before Dad met and married Mum, and the six of us came along, his childhood was spent in war‑torn London, specifically Chelsea. He often mentioned exploring the bomb sites. His younger sister, our Auntie Pat, describes him growing up — affectionately — as “a little sod”. Always messing about with his mates, pulling pranks, and generally getting up to mischief.</p>

    <p>It strikes me that Dad’s love of the <em>Just William</em> books comes from that, and I can’t help picturing him as William Brown — surrounded by his gang, getting up to harmless trouble, always with a plan that seemed like a good idea at the time. Auntie Pat must have felt like Violet Elizabeth — doing her best to keep some order and not always succeeding.</p>

    <p>That mischievous streak never really left him. It just grew up, got slightly more subtle — and occasionally involved kippers, as you’ll hear shortly.</p>

    <p>I also think about Mum and Dad as parents, particularly in the 60s. Bringing up six children on one fairly modest wage couldn’t have been easy. There wasn’t a lot of money about, and we didn’t grow up with much in the way of material things, but none of us were aware of a feeling of hardship — and looking back, I can’t figure out how they did it. What they did give us growing up was far more important.</p>

    <p>All six of us went into adult life well prepared — not financially perhaps, but with solid values, common sense, resilience, humour, and the ability to get on with people. We learned to work hard, how to laugh, how to make do, and how to look after one another. And that didn’t happen by accident.</p>

    <p>We had a good childhood. It was fun, we never felt we were missing out, and there was always food on the table — and that support was always there if it was needed.</p>

    <p>So I’ll finish by saying thank you — to Mum and Dad — for everything they did for the six of us and the younger generations, and hand over to Jeanette, who’d like to share a few thoughts of her own.</p>
